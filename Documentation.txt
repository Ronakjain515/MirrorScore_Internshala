My Name is Ronak jain. I have given a task for an Internship through Internshala. Here’s a short description of the given task.
1. Ubuntu is used as a platform to complete this task.
2. Django Rest Framework is used to develop this given task project.


This project consists of Two API’s, which are describe below:
1. First API:-
method – GET (not parameter required)
url - /ping
response – {“Status”: “OK”}
description – This used to check wheater server is active or not, if server is active and working then it will always response “Status”: “OK”.
2. Second API:-
method – GET (“date” parameter required)
url - /
response – if date is matched then returns status code HTTP_200_OK
                   else return status code HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST

description – This takes one parameter “date” is time stamp format e.g. 1510194235 




The given task is hard to understand even I have asked to Ashish Sinha on Internshala chat to explain it more but he didn’t respond to it. It is possible that I have done something wrong and you want me to do something else.
